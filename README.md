 I recently completed a project focused on detecting spam emails using text classification techniques. The project involved cleaning and preprocessing email data, extracting features using TF-IDF vectorization, and evaluating various machine learning models.
 Here's a summary of what I did:

Data Cleaning: Removed non-alphanumeric characters and converted text to lowercase.
Feature Extraction: Used TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features.
Model Training: Compared Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers for spam detection.
Evaluation: Achieved the following results
 Naive Bayes Classifier:
Accuracy: [ 0.97]
SVM Classifier:
Accuracy: [ 0.99]]
Model Fine-Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for the SVM model.
 Some key takeaways:

Text preprocessing is crucial for improving model performance.
TF-IDF is effective for feature extraction in text data.
Comparing different models helps in selecting the best one for the task
